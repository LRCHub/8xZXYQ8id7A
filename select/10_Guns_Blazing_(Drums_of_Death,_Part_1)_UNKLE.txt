Styles like Al Pacino
Reno until the Barcelino
The mad Dino with the bambino
The Gambino
Bigger than Jim Colosimo
More reservoir dogs than Tarantino
Scales for Venezuela
Brown as nino
Making the block hotter than jalepenos
G. Luciano
Be wettin' shit like Pesci in Casino
Fifty dollar cigar seer
The Bosnia
The mafia
Don poet like Garcia
Drug Czar and the Baby-P.A. beater
The M-8 behind the bar-freer
The Poconos
The Panama skier
Down with the parmesan
Ready to bomb like Vietnam with arms
'Cause the hollow-points and phenomenon
The cheddar-spreader
The killer with the gold Beretta
N...-deader
Sweater-letter with the hollow letter
Drama-setter
The Paneretta gettin' redder kids and momma-shredder
Infrared glow off the armor better
The godfather
The problem solver
Coming through with the 6-shell revolver
Hot as lava
Gun skills that's rea
And in the 'ville I be the barber
Gangster saga
The motherfuckin' face carver

Give you a dose of shit that's dope as soda
The underworld family Cosa Nostra
Pearl handle inside the shoulder holster
G. Luciano with a click but nothin' but N... s & Chicanos
You get hit up like Castellano
Italiano like crime familia
N... don't get familiar
Me and my goons might have to kill you
Up in New York
We play bloodsports at home court
And hold down forts
Soon as ya caught
Get your dome torched
G Rap and DJ Shadow leave your bone squashed
Squeeze the chrome short
Take no shorts
We judge and jury in the home court
Give you the clown corpse dead on the sidewalk
Surrounded by mad pedefors
Your whole frame laid in the white chalk
You got the smoking section
First-class tickets to resurrection
Forever destined to a place where N... s never restin'
Headed in Hell's direction
Lost at the crossroads and intersection
Should've wore a vest for chest protection
Slug fill you to capacity
Someone at the dance
Someone with the hand velocity of Butch Cassidy
Bitch Nigger with the audacity to blaspheme me
Got yourself caught in a motherfuckin' tragedy

Word
Drums of death
