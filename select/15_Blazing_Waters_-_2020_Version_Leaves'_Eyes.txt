Eager tongues they spread the word
Men uprising have you heard

The foeman came from out the east
Keen for the fray as for a feast

Lo the blazing waters
When axe and sword besiege the sky
Blazing waters
Uprising forces cry

Ravens crowing
We stand beneath the flaming tide
Lo the blazing waters
Uprising fleet defeated
Backs up faces down in heaps
Foe has fallen burning ships

The foeman flee to the island rocks
Savage berserks insanely mad

Eirik forced to the ground
Sulke burned to the ground
Sute a fallen earl
Kjøtve a fleeing twirl

Foeman from the east arrays his warriors
Enemies form the south
Ad victoriam
Foeman from the north calls his warriors
Enemies from the west
Ad victoriam
Vengeance in the blood of the warrior
Calling

Enemy
In hell he weeps
Seabed
Heroes sleep

The foeman came form out the east
Keen for the fray a bloody bloody feast

Uprising forces cry
Beneath the flaming tide
